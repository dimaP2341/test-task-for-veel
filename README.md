## Todo App using Next.js and JSONPlaceholder API

This project is a simple Todo application built using Next.js, React Hooks, and the JSONPlaceholder API. The app allows users to:

- Fetch and display a list of todos from the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Add a new todo.
- Delete a todo.

The app uses Tailwind CSS for basic styling and utilizes Axios for making API requests to perform CRUD operations.

## Features

- Fetch a list of todos with a limit of 10 items from the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Create a new todo by adding it to the list.
- Delete a todo from the list.

## Setup Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-app-nextjs.git
cd todo-app-nextjs
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This will start the app locally at http://localhost:3000.
